# Ball Breaker
This is a clone of Arkanoid. First project on Ironhack

## Description
Ball Breaker is a game where the player controls a paddle which prevents a ball from falling from the playing field, attempting to bounce it against a different number of bricks. When the ball stricks a brick it causes the brick to disapear. The goal is to remove all the bricks before the player runs out of time or lives.

## MVP (DOM - CANVAS)
- the game has a paddle that moves horizontally
- the paddle shoots a ball agains some bricks that are on the top area of the screen
- the ball hit one or several bricks causing them to disappear
- after hitting one or more bricks the ball will fall to the bottom of the playing area 
- the player must move the ship to the area where it will fall to hit it again upwards and hit some bricks again
- if the paddle doesn't hit the ball game over
